Because essentially what I want to be able to do is like, if I connect to Wi-Fi, I want all of my mail and Slack and Obsidian whatever open, so that all the background processing can occur. Does Obsidian actually do processing in the background? I wonder, I'll have to look into that as well, like is it allowed to do work in the background? It definitely should be so that it can do like, get pulls and pushes, but probably it has to be open for that. Okay, would be nice if Obsidian could do notifications, I'll see if that's a possibility, I've definitely seen someone talk about that, but the ideal event essentially is that I want to have a bunch of these apps open in the background, and it would be good to see if that can happen. And then the other really important one is I really want Google to be able to open the phone when I ask to call someone, or just open the phone app again in the background so it doesn't overtake the Waze app. That would be really good if that were possible, but we will see. Okay, well, I'm at work!",
