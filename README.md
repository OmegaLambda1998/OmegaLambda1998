# Omega Lambda

Welcome to my GitHub page. Here you will find my projects, modules, packages, abandoned hobbies, and other such programmatic oddities. I've attempted to organise this mess using a rough approximation of a PARA system, in which my various repositories have been allocated into the following categories:

## [Projects]

## [Areas](/Areas/README.md)

## [Resources](/Resources/README.md)

## [Archive](/Archive/README.md)

[Projects]: /Projects/README.md "Projects"
