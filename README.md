# Omega Lambda

Welcome to my GitHub page. Here you will find my projects, modules, packages, abandoned hobbies, and other such programmatic oddities. I've attempted to organise this mess using a rough approximation of a PARA system, in which my various repositories have been allocated into the following categories:

## [Projects](https://github.com/OmegaLambda1998/Projects)

Anything with a due date, including packages, papers, groups, etcâ€¦

## [Areas](https://github.com/OmegaLambda1998/Areas)

## [Resources](https://github.com/OmegaLambda1998/Resources)

## [Archives](https://github.com/OmegaLambda1998/Archives)

---

As the PARA system is used somewhat recursively, a flattened view of the entire structure can be found [here](/TOC.md).
