# Omega Lambda

Welcome to my GitHub page. Here you will find my projects, modules, packages, abandoned hobbies, and other such programmatic oddities. I've attempted to organise this mess using a rough approximation of a PARA system, in which my various repositories have been allocated into the following categories:

## [Projects]

## [Areas]

## [Resources]

## [Archive]

[Projects]: https://github.com/OmegaLambda1998/Projects "Projects"
[Areas]: https://github.com/OmegaLambda1998/Areas "Areas"
[Resources]: https://github.com/OmegaLambda1998/Resources "Resources"
[Archive]: https://github.com/OmegaLambda1998/Archive "Archive"
