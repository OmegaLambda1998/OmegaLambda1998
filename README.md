# Omega Lambda

Welcome to my GitHub page. Here you will find my projects, modules, packages, abandoned hobbies, and other such programmatic oddities. I've attempted to organise this mess using a rough approximation of a PARA system, in which my various repositories have been allocated into the following categories:

- [Projects](https://github.com/OmegaLambda1998/Projects): Anything with a due date, including packages, papers, groups, etc…

- [Areas](https://github.com/OmegaLambda1998/Areas): Broader topics which never really end such as journaling, health, etc…

- [Resources](https://github.com/OmegaLambda1998/Resources): A place to store auxiliary, static files used by multiple projects or areas.

- [Archive](https://github.com/OmegaLambda1998/Archive): Projects which have finished, moved here to avoid clutter without needing to delete them.

---

As the PARA system is used somewhat recursively, a flattened view of the entire structure can be found [here](/TOC.md).
