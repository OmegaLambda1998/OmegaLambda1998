# Session: @title(Walk without Rhythm - Continued)

## Timeline

### 5000 Years Ago
5000 years ago: @link(Ematha Foni) is taken by @link(Ri na Deithe) and spends 50 years researcing @link(Forsa Draiochta) and the means to resurrect a dead god. This results in the creation of the @link(Ritual of Apotheosis), capable of drawing @link(Forsa Draiochta) from the rivers of energy known as the Ley Lines and transferring that energy into another being, living or dead.

### 4000 Years Ago
4000 years ago: @link(Ematha Foni), an extremely accomplished necromancer, has maintained her vitality by repeatedly transferring her @link(Forsa Draiochta) into new bodies through the @link(Ritual of Apotheosis). To keep up appearances, every few centuries she would use a combination of Simulacrum and Soul Transfer to allow her original preserved body to make an appearance, keeping her ritual a secret.

Meanwhile, a young [Adaros](https://www.aonprd.com/RacesDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Adaro) named @link(Noferrer) leaves the @link(Ocean Portal). An explorer at heart, he spent much of his youth reading the @link(Book of Ematha) and dreaming about the foreign lands described within. Immediately after leaving the @link(Ocean Portal), he finds himself swept by a deep ocean current and is washed up on the shores of the @link(Isle's of Treachery). Having read about @(Amfaibia Scanruil)'s treachery, @link(Noferrer) expected a desolate wasteland, and was surprised to be greeted by some Kappa fishermen who gladly guided him to a nearby cove where he could safely swim and hunt. There he met the other Kappa, sharing knowledge of his Oceanic home in return for information regarding this island. He spent the better part of 25 years slowly gaining trust and respect amongst the many cultures of this island. Eventually, he had garnered enough respect, and showed equal respect in return, to be invited by the Lizardfolk to enter the gaping maw of the island that these people believed to be the corpse of @link(Amfaibia Scranruil). There he learnt of their most sacred beliefs, that of the @link(Apocalypse of Decomposition). They held the belief that it was @link(Amfaibia Scranruil) who defeated the @link(Plaguebringer), voluntarily consuming the foul creature. And in the belly of their island corpse, the last remnants of the @link(Plaguebringer) still slumbered, slowly eating the island from the inside out, preparing to emerge once more. Thus the islanders entire society is driven and consumed by a vitriolic obsession with preservation and the destruction of all things rot.

This was in direct contradiction to the @link(Book of Ematha), leading @link(Noferrer) to seek out @link(Ematha Foni). Though it took many years, and much effort, @link(Noferrer) was eventually able to meet @link(Ematha Foni) and convince her to investigate this inconsistency in the annuls of history.

### 3000 to 1000 years ago

@link(Ematha Foni) and @link(Noferrer) spend the next two millenia investigating ancient tombs, dead religions, and buried secrets across all the planes to uncover the source of the inconsistency. Throughout their travels they spend much time together, growing closer, trusting each other more, and believing ever more in the necessity of their goals.

### 1000 years ago

@link(Noferrer) discovers that @link(Ri na Deithe) had ordered @link(Taisteal I Bhfad) to track their movements and try to discover what it was they were investigating. Fearing retribution, and knowing their combined powers, though impressive, were negligible in the face of the gods, the two began a plot to delay the gods and provide them with the time needed to find the answers to the questions they had.

### 200 years ago

@link(Ematha Foni) takes on the guise of @(Liveloula), and @link(Noferrer) takes on the guise of @link(Haht Grae).

### 50 years ago

Needing essence of the gods as a catalyst for their @link(Mass Ethereal Imprisonment), @link(Ematha Foni) petitioned @link(Urania) for a droplet of her blood from which the essence of the Mother, and thus all gods, could be drawn. In return @link(Ematha Foni) agreed to teach @link(Urania) the @link(Ritual of Apotheosis).

### 25 years ago

@link(Elyndra Syllnan)'s draconic patron is given the t

### 5 Years Ago

- @link(Ematha Foni) and @link(Haht Grae ) trigger the @link(Mass Ethereal Imprisonment).

- @link(Elyndra Syllnan)'s draconic patron is absorbed into the @link(Mass Ethereal Imprisonment).

- @link(Emperor Fortis) witnesses the absorption of @link(Miotail a Bhrionnu) with whom the Emperor was conversing. @link(Miotail a Bhrionnu)'s last words were "It comes from the Mountain, Mother calls to me!". Leading the Emperor to prepare for war to take the Mountain.

## Combat

### The Tunnels

@link(Elyndra) is waiting here to warn the players. After seeing the obvious signs of bore worms in the wreckage of the workshop, @link(Haht Grae) frantically followed the tiny one-inch tunnels left by the maggots, breaking apart the rock with his fists. As they tunneled through the bedrock, the path of the maggots began to grow, from an inch wide, to a foot wide, 5ft wide, and finally a 10ft diamater tunnel which they could easily walk through. Eventually they made it here, and @link(Haht Grae) told @link(Elyndra) to wait at the entrance, and continued south. He said that this was a Bore Worm nest, though the worms seem to have been pacified somewhat by the presence of the Bore Worm Empress. As long as you don't wake them or let your presence be known, you won't need to worry about them at all.

#### Allies

[Haht Grae](https://www.aonprd.com/NPCDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Ageless%20Master)

#### Enemies

1x [Empress Bore Worm](https://www.aonprd.com/MonsterDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Empress%20Bore%20Worm): The longer the party takes to get here, the more of an advantage the Bore Worm Empress will have. The goal of this combat is not necessarily to defeat the Bore Worm Empress, but to extract the single golden shining maggot from within its writhing flesh.

### Special Rules

6

Until aggravated, the worm's tremorsense can be avoided via:
- 5ft movement per round steps which do not trigger the tremorsense at all
- 10ft movement per round steps which allow the player to make a Stealth check whilst within the worm's tremorsense to attempt to avoid being seen
- For every 5ft of movement above 10, the worm gets an additional +2 to its perception check.
- Long Jump out of range
- Player specific options

Once aggravated (once a worm has detected the presence of any creature), its tremorsense works as normal, and can not be stealthed or avoided.
